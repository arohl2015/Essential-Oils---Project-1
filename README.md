# Essential-Oils- Project 1

## Team:
Danielle Pollesche, Jaclyn Hardy, & April Rohl

## Project Idea and Motivation:
Our group put together a project to educate and keep people informed about the various uses of Essential Oils, outside of them being used for "smelling good". This was a topical idea, as you can create natural hand sanitizer using essential oils, along woth other health and wellness benefits. We also liked that this topic could appeal to many individuals.

## Responsibilities:
* Danielle: Essential oil expertise, CSS, HTML, how-to page, and finding a new tech we hadn’t used
* Jaclyn: Research, HTML/CSS for top 10 page, finding a new tech we hadn’t used, and GitHub/Terminal knowledge
* April:  APIs, Hand Sanitizer page, management of GitHub repository and presentation

## Challenges:
* Finding APIs that tied into our topic (there were none specifically for essential oils)
* Finding free APIs. Did a lot of research into ones that turned into dead ends as they required a storefront, billing information, or had limits on use.
* Inserting new technology into the project we hadn't used before
* The initial submitting and approval of branches to merge all our work together

## Future Improvement's We'd Like to Make:
* Addition of more features – i.e. tying in astrology to essential oils
* Further expansion to the linked storefront to tie it in with other APIs
* Building it out with an external database to capture consumer feedback and comments
